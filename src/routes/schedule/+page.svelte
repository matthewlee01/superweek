<h3>free time</h3>
<p>• There will be a mix of indoor and outdoor activities on Mon + Tue.</p> 
<p>• Youth cannot go back to the hotel without permission from their Youth Pastor.</p>
<p>• We’d
like B+Y to hang out with us - but we can’t stop adults from going back to the hotel.</p>
<p>• We are offering free counselling and / or spiritual direction and / or general
guidance in the sanctuary.</p>
<p>• There are showers at ROMC - but if it’s hot, you may
want to wait until the end of the night.</p>
<p class="asterisk">* do not hang outside the church building
after 10pm (we want to be good witnesses to our neighbours)</p>
